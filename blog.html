    Date: Friday, September 23th 2016<br>
    I have difficulties with posting my assignment to my ENGR web page. <br>
    The instructions given by the instructor indicates that I have to put the html files on the Drive Y:. <br>
    I am surprised that I do not have the Drive Y: in my laptop, and do not know what to do next. <br>
    Maybe I should go to tech support on Monday to reset my web directory. <br>
    I just hope that I am able to submit before the time is due.
